# Identifying Which Transactions Experience the Anomalies

Let me identify which specific transactions experience the anomalies in each schedule:

## Schedule i: < T4A, T2A, T2B, T2C, T4B, T4C >

- **Lost Update**: 
  - **T4** experiences a lost update on Y: T4 writes Y=d, but T2 overwrites it with Y=b before T4 can commit.
  - **T2** experiences a lost update on X: T2 writes X=b, but T4 overwrites it with X=d after T2 commits.

## Schedule ii: < T4A, T1A, T4B, T1B, T1C, T4C >

- **Lost Update**: 
  - **T4** experiences a lost update on X: T4 writes X=d, but T1 overwrites it with X=x0+1 without considering T4's update.
  - **T1** is at risk because it reads X before T4 writes to it, so T1's computation is based on potentially outdated data.

## Schedule iii: < T5A, T1A, T5B, T1B, T1C, T5C >

- **Lost Update**: 
  - **T5** experiences a lost update on X: T5 writes X=2*x0, but T1 overwrites it with X=x0+1.
  - Both **T1** and **T5** read the same value of X and then try to update it, leading to a write-write conflict.

## Schedule iv: < T3A, T2A, T2B, T3B, T3C, T2C >

- **Non-repeatable Read**: 
  - **T3** experiences a non-repeatable read on Y: T3 reads Y twice and gets different values (first y0, then b after T2's write).

## Summary Table: Transactions Experiencing Anomalies

| Schedule | Anomaly | Affected Transactions |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| i.       | Lost Update | T2 and T4 |
| ii.      | Lost Update | T4 (and indirectly T1) |
| iii.     | Lost Update | T5 (and indirectly T1) |
| iv.      | Non-repeatable Read | T3 |

These anomalies occur because the transactions are interleaved in ways that allow them to interfere with each other's operations. In practice, database systems use concurrency control mechanisms to prevent these anomalies by ensuring transactions execute in a way that preserves correctness and consistency.
