--S0 -> Step 0

--BEGIN S0  Run BEFORE EVERY EXERCISE
drop table if exists conta;

create table conta(
   id integer primary key,
   saldo real
);

start transaction;
  insert into conta values(1111,1000);
  insert into conta values(2222,2000);
commit;
select * from conta;
-- END S0
```

Output:

|"id"|"saldo"|
|----|-------|
|1111|1000|
|2222|2000|

---

Then, from the file ```/Test1/Utilizador1.sql``` run:

```sql
-- S1
start transaction;
set transaction isolation level read uncommitted;
```

Output:

```txt
SET

Query returned successfully in 45 msec.
```
---

From file ```/Test1/Utilizador2.sql``` run:

```sql
-- S2
start transaction;

-- S3
update conta set saldo = saldo-500 where id = 2222;
```

Output:

```txt
START TRANSACTION

Query returned successfully in 22 msec.
```

---

Returning to file ```/Test1/Utilizador1.sql``` run:

```sql
--S4
select saldo from conta where id = 1111;
```

Output:

|"saldo"|
|-----|
|1000|

```sql
--S5
select saldo from conta where id = 2222
```

Output:

|"saldo"|
|------|
|2000|

---

Back again to ```/Test1/Utilizador2.sql``` and run:

```sql
-- S6
commit;
```

Output:

```txt
COMMIT

Query returned successfully in 26 msec.
```

---

And, returning to ```/Test/Utilizador1.sql```, run:

```sql
-- S7
commit;
```

Output:

```txt
COMMIT

Query returned successfully in 44 msec.
```

```sql
select saldo from conta;
```

Output:

|"saldo"|
|-------|
|1000|
|2000|


## Explain the behaviour observed, taking into account what would normally happen with the 2PL protocol.

This behavior demonstrates a **"dirty read"** - reading uncommitted changes made by another transaction.

### What Would Happen with 2PL (Two-Phase Locking)

The 2PL (Two-Phase Locking) protocol is designed to ensure serializability of transactions by following these rules:

1. **Growing Phase**: A transaction may obtain locks but not release any locks
2. **Shrinking Phase**: A transaction may release locks but not obtain any new locks

Under strict 2PL (the most common implementation):

- When Utilizador2 executes `UPDATE conta SET saldo = saldo-500 WHERE id = 2222`, it would acquire an **exclusive (X) lock** on row 2222
- When Utilizador1 tries to execute `SELECT saldo FROM conta WHERE id = 2222`, it would need a **shared (S) lock** on row 2222
- Since X locks and S locks are incompatible, Utilizador1 would be **blocked** and forced to wait until Utilizador2 commits and releases its X lock
- As a result, Utilizador1 would never see the intermediate value (1500) before it was committed

#### Comparison Table

| Scenario | READ UNCOMMITTED | 2PL Protocol |
|----------|------------------|--------------|
| U2 updates row 2222 | Row is updated to 1500 | Row is updated to 1500 with X lock |
| U1 tries to read row 2222 | Returns 1500 (dirty read) | Blocks until U2 commits |
| U2 commits | Changes are permanent | Changes are permanent, locks released |
| U1 can now read | Still sees 1500 | Now sees 1500 (committed data) |

### Key Differences Explained

1. **Concurrency vs. Consistency Trade-off**:
   - `READ UNCOMMITTED` allows higher concurrency (no blocking) but sacrifices consistency (allows dirty reads)
   - 2PL ensures consistency (no dirty reads) but reduces concurrency (transactions must wait)

2. **ACID Properties**:
   - `READ UNCOMMITTED` violates the Isolation property of ACID
   - 2PL maintains all ACID properties, ensuring transactions appear to execute in isolation

3. **Locking Behavior**:
   - `READ UNCOMMITTED` essentially ignores read locks, allowing transactions to read data that is locked for writing
   - 2PL enforces both read (shared) and write (exclusive) locks, preventing dirty reads

4. **Performance vs. Correctness**:
   - `READ UNCOMMITTED` is faster in high-contention scenarios but can lead to incorrect application behavior
   - 2PL guarantees correctness but may lead to performance issues due to blocking

### Practical Implications

The `READ UNCOMMITTED` isolation level is rarely used in practice because:

1. Applications reading uncommitted data may make incorrect decisions
2. If Utilizador2 had rolled back instead of committing, Utilizador1 would have based decisions on data that never actually existed in the database
3. Most applications require at least `READ COMMITTED` (the default in PostgreSQL) to avoid dirty reads

This exercise demonstrates why understanding transaction isolation levels is crucial for database application developers, as they directly impact both the correctness and performance of your applications.
