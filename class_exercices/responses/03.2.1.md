# Analysis of Transaction Schedule Anomalies

Let me analyze each schedule to identify the concurrency anomalies. First, let's clarify what each transaction does:

- **T1**: Reads X, increments it by 1, writes X, commits
- **T2**: Writes X with value b, writes Y with value b, commits
- **T3**: Reads Y twice, commits
- **T4**: Writes Y with value d, writes X with value d, commits
- **T5**: Reads X, doubles its value, writes X, commits

## Schedule i: < T4A, T2A, T2B, T2C, T4B, T4C >

Execution trace:

```txt
T4A: d →w(Y)     // T4 writes Y = d
T2A: b →w(X)     // T2 writes X = b
T2B: b →w(Y)     // T2 overwrites Y = b (previously d from T4)
T2C: commit      // T2 commits
T4B: d →w(X)     // T4 overwrites X = d (previously b from T2)
T4C: commit      // T4 commits
```
**Anomalies in schedule i**:
- **Lost Update**: T2 writes Y, which overwrites T4's earlier write to Y. Then T4 writes X, which overwrites T2's write to X. Each transaction loses one of its updates.
- **Non-serializable Schedule**: This schedule's result (X=d, Y=b) doesn't match any serial execution of T2 and T4. If T2 executed first, we'd have X=b, Y=b. If T4 executed first, we'd have X=d, Y=d.

## Schedule ii: < T4A, T1A, T4B, T1B, T1C, T4C >

Execution trace:

```txt
T4A: d →w(Y)     // T4 writes Y = d
T1A: a ←r(X)     // T1 reads X (original value, let's call it x0)
T4B: d →w(X)     // T4 writes X = d
T1B: (a+1) →w(X) // T1 writes X = x0+1 (overwriting T4's write of d)
T1C: commit      // T1 commits
T4C: commit      // T4 commits
```

**Anomalies in schedule ii**:
- **Lost Update**: T4 writes X=d, but this update is lost when T1 overwrites X without considering T4's update.
- **Non-serializable Schedule**: This schedule doesn't correspond to either serial execution (T1 then T4, or T4 then T1).

## Schedule iii: < T5A, T1A, T5B, T1B, T1C, T5C >

Execution trace:

```txt
T5A: d ←r(X)     // T5 reads X (original value, let's call it x0)
T1A: a ←r(X)     // T1 also reads the original X value (x0)
T5B: (d×2) →w(X) // T5 writes X = 2*x0
T1B: (a+1) →w(X) // T1 writes X = x0+1 (overwriting T5's write)
T1C: commit      // T1 commits
T5C: commit      // T5 commits
```

**Anomalies in schedule iii**:
- **Lost Update**: T5 writes X=2*x0, but this update is lost when T1 overwrites it with x0+1.
- **Non-serializable Schedule**: The final result doesn't match either T1→T5 or T5→T1 serial execution.

## Schedule iv: < T3A, T2A, T2B, T3B, T3C, T2C >

Execution trace:

```txt
T3A: a ←r(Y)     // T3 reads Y (original value, let's call it y0)
T2A: b →w(X)     // T2 writes X = b
T2B: b →w(Y)     // T2 writes Y = b
T3B: a ←r(Y)     // T3 reads Y again, now sees Y = b
T3C: commit      // T3 commits
T2C: commit      // T2 commits
```

**Anomalies in schedule iv**:
- **Non-repeatable Read**: T3 reads Y twice and gets different values (y0 first, then b after T2's write).
- This is a **recoverable schedule** because T3 (which reads data written by T2) commits after T2 commits.
- This schedule is actually **serializable** as it's equivalent to the serial schedule T2→T3 (even though T3 starts first).

## Summary of Anomalies

| Schedule | Anomalies |
|----------|-----------|
| i.       | Lost Update, Non-serializable Schedule |
| ii.      | Lost Update, Non-serializable Schedule |
| iii.     | Lost Update, Non-serializable Schedule |
| iv.      | Non-repeatable Read (but still serializable) |

These anomalies demonstrate why proper concurrency control mechanisms like locking protocols or timestamp ordering are essential in database systems to maintain consistency while allowing concurrent execution.
