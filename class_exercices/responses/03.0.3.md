--BEGIN S0  Run BEFORE EVERY EXERCISE
drop table if exists conta;

create table conta(

start transaction;
  insert into conta values(1111,1000);
  insert into conta values(2222,2000);

-- END S0
```

Output:

|"id"|"saldo"|
|----|-------|
|1111|1000|
|2222|2000|

Then, from the file ```/Test3/Utilizador1.sql``` run:

```sql
-- S1:
begin transaction;
set transaction isolation level read committed;
```

Output:

```txt

From file ```/Test3/Utilizador2.sql``` run:

```sql
-- S2:
begin transaction;
set transaction isolation level read committed; 
```

Output:

```txt

```

Returning to file ```/Test3/Utilizador1.sql``` run:

```sql
-- S3:
update conta set saldo = saldo+100 where id = 1111;
```

Output:

```txt
UPDATE 1

Query returned successfully in 25 msec.
```

Back again to ```/Test3/Utilizador2.sql``` and run:

```sql
-- S4
update conta set saldo = saldo+100 where id = 2222;
```

Output:

```txt
UPDATE 1

Query returned successfully in 22 msec.
```

And, returning to ```/Test3/Utilizador1.sql```, run:

```sql
-- S5:
update conta set saldo = saldo+100 where id = 2222;
```

No Output - **waitng for query to complete**

Afer 3 min:

```txt

```

Again, to ```/Test3/Utilizador2.sql```, run:

```sql
-- S6
update conta set saldo = saldo+100 where id = 1111;
```

Output:

Returning to ```/Test3/Utilizador1```, run:

```sql

## Questions:

## a) Explain the observed behaviour.

What we observed is a classic database deadlock scenario that occurred due to two concurrent transactions (User1 and User2) operating under the "read committed" isolation level.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of what happened:

1. **Step 0:** A table "conta" was created with two rows (accounts) with IDs 1111 and 2222, both with initial balances.

2. **Steps 1-2:** Two separate transactions were started by User1 and User2, both using "read committed" isolation level, which allows them to see committed changes from other transactions but prevents dirty reads.

3. **Step 3:** User1 updated account 1111, adding 100 to its balance. This operation took an exclusive lock on row 1111.

4. **Step 4:** User2 updated account 2222, adding 100 to its balance. This operation took an exclusive lock on row 2222.

5. **Step 5:** User1 tried to update account 2222 (which was locked by User2). Instead of failing immediately, the transaction waited for User2 to release the lock.

6. **Step 6:** User2 tried to update account 1111 (which was locked by User1). This created a circular wait condition - User1 waiting for User2 and User2 waiting for User1.

7. **Deadlock Detection:** After about 3 minutes, PostgreSQL detected this deadlock situation. When User2 tried to update account 1111, the database engine realized there was a deadlock and terminated User2's transaction with a deadlock error.

8. **Steps 7-8:** User1 was able to commit successfully. When User2 tried to commit, it reported a ROLLBACK instead, because the transaction had already been rolled back by the database engine due to the deadlock.

This scenario illustrates the classic deadlock pattern where:
- Transaction 1 acquires resource A, then tries to acquire resource B
- Transaction 2 acquires resource B, then tries to acquire resource A
- Neither can proceed, creating a circular wait condition

PostgreSQL's deadlock detector identified this situation and resolved it by choosing one transaction (User2's in this case) as the "victim" to be terminated, allowing the other transaction to complete successfully.

## b) Is there any way to prevent this behaviour by maintaining the order of the instructions in both transactions?

Yes, there is a straightforward way to prevent this deadlock while maintaining the same operations in both transactions: **ensure that all transactions access resources (rows) in the same consistent order**.

In your example, the deadlock occurred because:
- User1 locked row 1111 first, then tried to lock row 2222
- User2 locked row 2222 first, then tried to lock row 1111

### Solution: Consistent Resource Ordering

If both transactions accessed the rows in the same order (e.g., always updating the lower ID first), the deadlock would be prevented:

#### For User1's transaction:

```sql
-- Update row 1111 first (already doing this)
update conta set saldo = saldo+100 where id = 1111;
-- Then update row 2222
update conta set saldo = saldo+100 where id = 2222;
```

#### For User2's transaction:

```sql
-- First update row 1111 (instead of 2222)
update conta set saldo = saldo+100 where id = 1111;
-- Then update row 2222
update conta set saldo = saldo+100 where id = 2222;
```

With this approach, whichever transaction gets to row 1111 first will be able to complete its lock on row 2222 without interference from the other transaction, which will be waiting for row 1111 to be released.

This is a well-established practice in database systems:

1. **Resource Ordering**: Always access shared resources in a predictable, consistent order across all transactions.

2. **Primary Key Order**: A common approach is to order operations by primary key values (lowest to highest).

While this might cause one transaction to wait, it prevents the circular wait condition that causes deadlocks. The transaction that gets to the first row gets to complete before the second transaction starts processing.
