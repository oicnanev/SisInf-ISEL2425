## Questions:

### a) Why didn't the transaction get stuck in step t4 and instead get on hold in t5?

The transaction got stuck in step t5 (when querying account 2222) and not in step t4 (when querying account 1111) due to a combination of factors related to transaction isolation levels, locking mechanisms, and the specific operations performed. Let's analyze why:

#### Key Elements to Consider

1. **Transaction Isolation Levels**: 
   - Utilizador1 is using `READ UNCOMMITTED` isolation level
   - Utilizador2 is using the default isolation level (likely `READ COMMITTED` in PostgreSQL)

2. **Lock Types Used**:
   - Both queries in Utilizador1 use `FOR SHARE` clauses, which attempt to acquire shared locks
   - Utilizador2's `UPDATE` statement acquired an exclusive lock on the row with id=2222

3. **Sequence of Operations**:
   - Utilizador2 updated row 2222 (acquiring an exclusive lock)
   - Utilizador1 first queried row 1111 with `FOR SHARE`
   - Utilizador1 then tried to query row 2222 with `FOR SHARE`

#### Why t4 (Querying Row 1111) Succeeded

The query in step t4:

```sql
select saldo from conta where id = 1111 for share;
```

succeeded immediately because:

1. **No Lock Conflict**: Row 1111 had not been modified or locked by any other transaction. Utilizador2 only modified row 2222.

2. **Shared Lock Acquisition**: The `FOR SHARE` clause requested a shared lock on row 1111, which was immediately granted because no other transaction held a conflicting lock.

3. **Independent Data**: Even though Utilizador1 was using `READ UNCOMMITTED`, this had no effect here because the data for row 1111 was not being modified by any other transaction.

#### Why t5 (Querying Row 2222) Got Stuck

The query in step t5:

```sql
select saldo from conta where id = 2222 for share;
```

got stuck because:

1. **Lock Conflict**: 
   - Utilizador2 had already executed an `UPDATE` on row 2222, which acquired an exclusive (X) lock on that row
   - Utilizador1's `FOR SHARE` clause tried to acquire a shared (S) lock on the same row
   - Exclusive locks and shared locks are incompatible (X conflicts with S)

2. **Important Detail - `FOR SHARE` Override**: 
   - Even though Utilizador1 was using `READ UNCOMMITTED` isolation level, which normally would allow reading uncommitted data without waiting for locks
   - **The `FOR SHARE` clause explicitly requested a lock**, which overrides the isolation level's default behavior
   - `FOR SHARE` will always try to acquire a shared lock regardless of isolation level

3. **PostgreSQL Lock Compatibility**:
   - In PostgreSQL, when a row has an exclusive lock from an update operation, any attempt to acquire a shared lock on that same row will be blocked until the exclusive lock is released
   - This blocking occurred even though the transaction was using `READ UNCOMMITTED`

#### The Critical Insight

The key insight is that **the `FOR SHARE` clause forces lock acquisition** regardless of isolation level. If Utilizador1 had used a simple `SELECT` without the `FOR SHARE` clause:

```sql
select saldo from conta where id = 2222;  -- without FOR SHARE
```

With `READ UNCOMMITTED` isolation level, it would have read the uncommitted updated value (-500) from Utilizador2 without getting blocked, because `READ UNCOMMITTED` allows dirty reads and doesn't request shared locks for simple reads.

By adding `FOR SHARE`, Utilizador1 explicitly requested lock acquisition, which conflicts with Utilizador2's exclusive lock - thus causing the transaction to wait until Utilizador2 either committed or rolled back.

#### Conclusion

The transaction didn't get stuck in step t4 because there was no lock conflict on row 1111. It got stuck in step t5 because the `FOR SHARE` clause explicitly requested a shared lock on row 2222, which conflicted with Utilizador2's exclusive lock on the same row, overriding the expected behavior of the `READ UNCOMMITTED` isolation level.

### b) Explain the values of the balances obtained by the various select instructions.

#### Initial State (after S0)
After running the initialization script, we have:
- Account 1111: Balance = 1000
- Account 2222: Balance = 2000

#### Step S4 (Utilizador1)

```sql
select saldo from conta where id = 1111 for share;
```

**Result**: 1000

**Explanation**:
- This query returned the original balance of account 1111 (1000)
- This is expected because:
  1. No transaction had modified account 1111
  2. The balance is the committed value from the initialization
  3. The `FOR SHARE` lock was acquired successfully as no other transaction held a conflicting lock

#### Step S5 (Utilizador1)

```sql
select saldo from conta where id = 2222 for share;
```

**Result**: [Query got stuck/blocked]

**Explanation**:
- This query did not return a result because it was blocked
- Despite Utilizador1 using `READ UNCOMMITTED` isolation level (which normally allows dirty reads), the `FOR SHARE` clause explicitly requested a lock
- The query was blocked because:
  1. Utilizador2 had an active `UPDATE` on row 2222, which held an exclusive lock
  2. The `FOR SHARE` clause tried to acquire a shared lock, which is incompatible with an exclusive lock
  3. PostgreSQL blocked the query until the lock conflict was resolved

#### Step S6 (Utilizador2)

```sql
rollback;
```

**Effect**: This rolled back Utilizador2's update, releasing the exclusive lock on account 2222.

## Implied Result After S6
After Utilizador2's rollback, Utilizador1's blocked query (S5) would finally proceed and return:
**Result for S5 (after unblocking)**: 2000

**Explanation**:
- Once Utilizador2 rolled back, its exclusive lock was released
- Utilizador1's blocked query could now acquire the shared lock it requested
- The value returned is 2000 because:
  1. Utilizador2's update (which changed the balance to 1500) was rolled back
  2. The database reverted to the last committed value (2000)

#### Step S7 (Utilizador1)

```sql
rollback;
select saldo from conta;
```

**Result**:
- Account 1111: 1000
- Account 2222: 2000

**Explanation**:
- This query shows both account balances after both transactions have been rolled back
- The values are the original committed values from the initialization:
  1. Account 1111 remained at 1000 (was never modified)
  2. Account 2222 returned to 2000 after Utilizador2's rollback

## Summary of Balance Values

| Step | Account | Value | Explanation |
|------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| S4   | 1111    | 1000           | Original committed value, never modified |
| S5   | 2222    | [Blocked]      | Query blocked due to lock conflict with Utilizador2's exclusive lock |
| S5 (after S6) | 2222 | 2000    | Original value after Utilizador2's rollback |
| S7   | All     | 1000, 2000     | Original values after both transactions rolled back |

#### Key Insights

1. **Lock Precedence Over Isolation Level**: The `FOR SHARE` clause overrode the `READ UNCOMMITTED` isolation level's usual behavior. Even though `READ UNCOMMITTED` would normally allow dirty reads without waiting for locks, the explicit lock request (`FOR SHARE`) forced the transaction to wait for lock acquisition.

2. **Transaction Integrity**: The final values demonstrate proper ACID properties - after both transactions were rolled back, the database maintained its initial consistent state.

3. **Lock Conflicts vs. Isolation Levels**: This exercise illustrates the difference between lock conflicts (which concern concurrent access to the same data) and isolation levels (which concern visibility of uncommitted changes).
