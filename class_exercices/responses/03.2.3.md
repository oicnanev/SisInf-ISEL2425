# Recommended Isolation Levels for Each Transaction

To prevent the observed anomalies, here are the appropriate isolation levels for each transaction:

## Transaction T1: `REPEATABLE READ` or `SERIALIZABLE`

**Operations**: Reads X, increments it by 1, writes X

**Reasoning**:
- T1 performs a read-modify-write operation on X
- This pattern is susceptible to lost updates if another transaction modifies X between T1's read and write
- `REPEATABLE READ` would prevent other transactions from changing X while T1 is in progress
- `SERIALIZABLE` would provide even stronger guarantees if X is part of a range query

## Transaction T2: `SERIALIZABLE`

**Operations**: Writes X and Y with the same value

**Reasoning**:
- T2 modifies multiple related objects (X and Y)
- T2 needs to ensure that no other transaction sees its partial updates
- `SERIALIZABLE` ensures that other transactions either see all of T2's changes or none of them
- The strongest isolation is justified since T2 is updating multiple related items

## Transaction T3: `REPEATABLE READ`

**Operations**: Reads Y twice

**Reasoning**:
- T3 reads the same data item (Y) multiple times and expects consistent results
- `READ COMMITTED` would not be sufficient as it allows non-repeatable reads
- `REPEATABLE READ` ensures that both reads of Y will return the same value

## Transaction T4: `SERIALIZABLE`

**Operations**: Writes Y and X with the same value

**Reasoning**:
- Similar to T2, T4 updates multiple related items (Y and X)
- T4 needs to ensure that no other transaction interrupts its updates
- `SERIALIZABLE` prevents other transactions from modifying either X or Y while T4 is active
- The modifications to multiple related items indicate a need for strong isolation

## Transaction T5: `REPEATABLE READ` or `SERIALIZABLE`

**Operations**: Reads X, doubles its value, writes X

**Reasoning**:
- T5 performs a read-modify-write operation on X (similar to T1)
- This pattern is vulnerable to lost updates
- `REPEATABLE READ` would prevent other transactions from changing X between T5's read and write
- `SERIALIZABLE` would be appropriate if X might be accessed through range queries

## Summary Table of Recommended Isolation Levels

| Transaction | Recommended Isolation Level | Reason |
|-------------|---------------------------|--------|
| T1          | REPEATABLE READ/SERIALIZABLE | Protects read-modify-write pattern from lost updates |
| T2          | SERIALIZABLE              | Ensures atomic updates to multiple related objects (X, Y) |
| T3          | REPEATABLE READ           | Prevents non-repeatable reads on Y |
| T4          | SERIALIZABLE              | Ensures atomic updates to multiple related objects (Y, X) |
| T5          | REPEATABLE READ/SERIALIZABLE | Protects read-modify-write pattern from lost updates |

## Additional Implementation Considerations

1. For transactions with read-modify-write patterns (T1, T5), an alternative to higher isolation levels would be to use explicit locking (SELECT FOR UPDATE) or optimistic concurrency control.

2. For transactions updating multiple objects (T2, T4), proper ordering of operations can sometimes reduce isolation requirements.

3. In many modern databases, SERIALIZABLE isolation uses snapshot isolation with serialization conflict detection rather than strict locking, which can provide better performance while still preventing anomalies.

These isolation levels would prevent the anomalies observed in the given schedules while balancing the need for concurrency and data consistency.
