--S0 -> Step 0

--BEGIN S0  Run BEFORE EVERY EXERCISE
drop table if exists conta;

create table conta(
   id integer primary key,
   saldo real
);

start transaction;
  insert into conta values(1111,1000);
  insert into conta values(2222,2000);
commit;
select * from conta;
-- END S0
```

Output:

|"id"|"saldo"|
|----|-------|
|1111|1000|
|2222|2000|

---

Then, from the file ```/Test5/Utilizador1.sql``` run:

```sql
-- S1:
begin transaction;
set transaction isolation level repeatable read;
```

Output:

```txt
SET

Query returned successfully in 34 msec.
```
---

From file ```/Test5/Utilizador2.sql```, run:

```sql
-- S2
update conta set saldo = saldo + 500 where id = 1111;
```

Output:

```txt
UPDATE 1

Query returned successfully in 28 msec.
```

---

Returning to file ```/Test5/Utilizador1.sql``` run:

```sql
--S3:
select * from conta where Id = 1111;
```

Output:

|"id"	|"saldo"|
|-----|-------|
|1111|	1500|

---

Back again to ```/Test5/Utilizador2.sql``` and run:

```sql
-- S4
update conta set saldo = saldo + 500 where id = 2222;
```

Output:

```txt
UPDATE 1

Query returned successfully in 21 msec.
```

---

And, returning to ```/Test5/Utilizador1.sql```, run:

```sql
-- S5
select * from conta where id = 2222;
```

Output:

|"id"	|"saldo"|
|-----|----|
|2222|	2000|

```sql
commit;
```

Output:

```txt
COMMIT

Query returned successfully in 41 msec.
```

```sql
select * from conta;
```

Output:

|"id"|"saldo"|
|----|-------|
|1111|1500|
|2222|2500|

## Questions:

### Explain the reason for the values observed in the select instructions

The observed behavior in Test5 appears inconsistent at first glance, but it highlights some important subtleties of PostgreSQL's implementation of the REPEATABLE READ isolation level.

#### Key Observations:

1. User1 starts a transaction with **REPEATABLE READ** isolation level
2. User2 updates account 1111, adding 500 to its balance (1000 → 1500)
3. **User1 sees the updated balance of 1500 for account 1111**
4. User2 updates account 2222, adding 500 to its balance (2000 → 2500)
5. **User1 sees the original balance of 2000 for account 2222**
6. After User1 commits and queries again, it sees all updates (1500 and 2500)

#### Explanation:

This behavior demonstrates a specific aspect of PostgreSQL's implementation of REPEATABLE READ:

##### First Query (account 1111):
User1 could see the updated value (1500) because **the first SELECT statement actually established the snapshot for the transaction**. In PostgreSQL, the snapshot isn't created when the transaction begins, but rather upon the first query that reads data.

Since User2 had already updated and committed the change to account 1111 before User1's first query, that updated value was included in User1's snapshot.

##### Second Query (account 2222):
User1 could NOT see the updated value for account 2222 because the update occurred AFTER User1's snapshot was established by the first query. This is the expected behavior of REPEATABLE READ - any changes committed after the snapshot was taken are not visible, ensuring consistent reads throughout the transaction.

##### After Commit:
After User1 committed and ran a new query, it started a new transaction with a fresh snapshot, seeing all committed changes.

#### The Core Principle:

In PostgreSQL's implementation of REPEATABLE READ:
1. The transaction snapshot is established at the time of the first query (not at BEGIN TRANSACTION)
2. All subsequent reads in the transaction use that same snapshot
3. Changes committed by other transactions before the snapshot was taken are visible
4. Changes committed after the snapshot was taken are invisible until the transaction completes and a new one begins

This explains why User1 could see the first update (it happened before User1's first query) but not the second update (it happened after User1's first query).

If we wanted all external updates to be invisible, we would need to use the SERIALIZABLE isolation level, or ensure that the snapshot is established at the very beginning of the transaction by executing a dummy read operation immediately after starting the transaction.
