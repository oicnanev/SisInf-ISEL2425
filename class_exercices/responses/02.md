## 2. Transaction scheduling.

- (a) Consider the following transactions:
  - T1 : r1(X); w1(Y ); c1
  - T2 : w2(X); r2(Y ); w2(Y ); c2
  - T3 : r3(X); r3(Z); w3(Z); c3

- (b) Consider the following schedules:
  - S1 : r1(X); w1(X); r2(X); w2(X); c1; c2
  - S2 : r2(X); w2(X); r1(X); w1(X); c1; c2
  - S3 : r1(X); r2(X); w2(X); w1(X); c1; c2

  ## Responses

- **1 a)** A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL statements that together form a logical unit of work.
  The SQL statements that form the transaction are typically closely related and perform interdependent actions.
  Each statement in the transaction performs some part of a task, but all of them are required to complete the task.
  Grouping the statements as a single transaction tells the DBMS that the entire statement sequence should be
  executed in a manner that passes what is known as the ACID test.
- **1 b)** For a transaction to be considered ACID it has to have these caracteristics:
  - **Atomic** A transaction has an all-or-nothing nature. Either all operations in a transaction are performed or none of them are performed.
    If some statements are executed and the transaction fails, the results of the statements that executed must be rolled back.
    Only when all statements are executed properly can a transaction be considered complete and the results of the transaction applied to the database.
  - **Consistent** A transaction must transform the database from one consistent state to another.
    The database must be consistent at the end of each transaction, meaning that all rules that define and
    constrain the data must be adhered to before the transaction can end. Also, no user should see inconsistent
    data because of changes made by transactions that have not yet completed.
  - **Isolated** Each transaction must execute on its own without interference from other transactions.
    To be isolated, no transaction can act upon changes made by other transactions until those transactions are complete.
  - **Durable** Once a transaction is complete, all changes made by it should be preserved.
    The data should be in a consistent state, even if a hardware or application error occurs after completion of the transaction.
    In object-oriented programming, the term persistence is used for this property.
- **1 c)** The difference between a **single-user database system** and a **multi-user database system** lies in how they handle access, concurrency, and resource management.
  single-user database system is designed to be used by **only one user at a time**. It is typically used in small-scale applications or personal use cases. **Key Differences**:

  | Feature                  | Single-User Database System          | Multi-User Database System          |
  |--------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
  | **Number of Users**      | One user at a time                   | Multiple users simultaneously       |
  | **Concurrency**          | No support for concurrent access     | Supports concurrent transactions    |
  | **Performance**          | Faster for single-user operations    | Optimized for multi-user workloads  |
  | **Scalability**          | Limited scalability                  | Highly scalable                    |
  | **Complexity**           | Simple design and implementation     | Complex design and implementation   |
  | **Use Cases**            | Personal or small-scale applications | Enterprise or collaborative systems |
  | **Examples**             | SQLite, Microsoft Access             | PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle          |

- **1 d)** When multiple transactions are executed concurrently in a database system, several problems can arise due to the interleaving of operations.
  These problems can lead to data inconsistency and integrity issues. Below is a summary of the **main problems** that can occur, along with examples and a table for quick reference.
  - **1. Dirty Read**
    - **Definition:** A transaction reads uncommitted data from another transaction that may later be rolled back.
    - **Example:**
      - Transaction A updates a row but does not commit.
      - Transaction B reads the updated row.
      - Transaction A rolls back its changes.
      - Transaction B now has incorrect (dirty) data.
  - **2. Non-Repeatable Read**
    - **Definition:** A transaction reads the same data twice, but the data changes between the two reads due to another transaction's update.
    - **Example:**
      - Transaction A reads a row.
      - Transaction B updates the same row and commits.
      - Transaction A reads the row again and sees a different value.
  - **3. Phantom Read**
    - **Definition:** A transaction executes the same query twice, but the result set changes due to another transaction inserting or deleting rows.
    - **Example:**
      - Transaction A executes a query and gets a set of rows.
      - Transaction B inserts a new row that matches the query criteria.
      - Transaction A executes the same query again and gets an additional row (phantom).
  - **4. Lost Update**
    - **Definition:** Two transactions update the same data concurrently, and one update overwrites the other.
    - **Example:**
      - Transaction A and Transaction B read the same row.
      - Transaction A updates the row and commits.
      - Transaction B updates the same row and commits, overwriting Transaction A's changes.
  - **5. Inconsistent Analysis (Uncommitted Dependency)**
    - **Definition:** A transaction reads a set of data that is being modified by another transaction, leading to inconsistent results.
    - **Example:**
      - Transaction A reads multiple rows while Transaction B is updating some of those rows.
      - Transaction A sees a mix of old and new values, leading to inconsistent analysis.

  ### **Summary Table**

  | Problem                | Description                                                                 | Example                                                                 |
  |------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | **Dirty Read**         | Reading uncommitted data that may be rolled back.                           | Transaction B reads uncommitted data from Transaction A, which rolls back. |
  | **Non-Repeatable Read**| Reading the same data twice yields different results due to updates.         | Transaction A reads a row, Transaction B updates it, Transaction A reads again. |
  | **Phantom Read**       | Executing the same query twice yields different result sets due to inserts.  | Transaction A queries rows, Transaction B inserts a new row, Transaction A queries again. |
  | **Lost Update**        | One transaction's update is overwritten by another transaction's update.     | Transaction A and B update the same row; B's update overwrites A's.     |
  | **Inconsistent Analysis** | Reading a mix of old and new data due to concurrent modifications.       | Transaction A reads rows while Transaction B updates some of them.      |

-**1 e)** In the context of database systems, a schedule (or history) is a sequence of operations (reads, writes, commits, aborts)
  performed by a set of concurrent transactions. It defines the order in which these operations are executed and how they interleave with each other. 
  Schedules are used to analyze and manage the behavior of concurrent transactions, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

- **1 f)** For a Schedule S1 composed of operations from transactions T1 and T2 to be valid and ensure data consistency, it must be
  **consistent** (get the BD from one consistent state to another consistent state) and **atomic** (as one instruction only preventing dirty-reads,
  phantom reads, non-repeatable reads and lost-update)

- **1 g)** Two operations in a schedule are said to be in conflict if they meet the following key requirements:
  - Belong to Different Transactions
  - Operate on the Same Data Item
  - At least one is Write
 
- **2 a i)** ```w2(X), r2(Y), w2(Y), r1(X), w1(Y), c1, c2``` Why Is It Not Recoverable?
  - T1 reads X (r1(X)) after T2 writes X (w2(X)).
  - T1 commits (c1) before T2 commits (c2).
  - If T2 were to abort after T1 commits, T1 would have read uncommitted data from T2, leading to an unrecoverable schedule.
- **2 a ii)** ```w2(X), r2(Y), w2(Y), r1(X), w1(Y), c2, c1```
  - Why Is It Recoverable?
    - T1 reads X (r1(X)) after T2 writes X (w2(X)).
    - T1 commits (c1) only after T2 commits (c2).
    - This ensures that T1 does not read uncommitted data from T2, making the schedule recoverable.
  - Why Is It Not Cascadeless?
    - T1 reads X (r1(X)) before T2 commits (c2).
    - If T2 were to abort before committing, T1 would have read uncommitted data, leading to a cascading rollback (T1 would also need to be rolled back).
    - Therefore, the schedule is not cascadeless.
- **2 b)**
  - S1 ```r1(X); w1(X); r2(X); w2(X); c1; c2```, precedence graph:  ```T1 -> T2``` The graph is acyclic, therefore S1 is conflict serializable.
  - S2 ```r2(X); w2(X); r1(X); w1(X); c1; c2```, precedence graph: ```T2 -> T1``` The graph is acyclic, therefore S2 is conflict serializable.
  - S3 ```r1(X); r2(X); w2(X); w1(X); c1; c2```, precedence graph: ```T2 -> T1``` The graph is acyclic, therefore S3 is conflict serializable.
  - S4 ```w2(X); w1(X); r1(X); r2(X); c1; c2```, precedence graph: ```T2 -> T1 -> T2```  The graph is cyclic, therefore S4 is not conflict serializable.
- **2 c i)** ```T1 -> T2 -> T3```
- **2 c ii)** There are no cycles in the graph, so the schedule S5 is conflict serializable.
- **2 d)** Not possible because T5 does not read any data written by T4.
- **3 a)** Failures:
  - System or Hardware failures
  - Transaction failures (eg. zero division, constraints violation, dead locks)
  - Cuncurrency control failures (eg. lost-update, unrepeatable-reads)
  - Disk failures
  - Catastrophic failures (eg. natural disasters)
- **3 b)** The concepts of **recoverable**, **cascadeless**, and **strict schedules** are related to how transactions interact with each other in a
  database system, particularly in terms of **reading and writing data** and ensuring **data consistency**. 
    - **1. Recoverable Schedule** A schedule is **recoverable** if no transaction commits until all transactions it depends on have committed.
      This ensures that no transaction reads uncommitted data that may later be rolled back.
    **Key Points:**
      - If **T2** reads data written by **T1**, then **T2** must commit only after **T1** commits.
      - Prevents **dirty reads** (reading uncommitted data).
    **Example:**
      - **T1:** `w(X)`
      - **T2:** `r(X)`
      - **Schedule:** `w1(X), r2(X), c1, c2`
      - **Recoverable:** T2 commits after T1 commits.

    - **2. Cascadeless Schedule** A schedule is **cascadeless** if no transaction reads data written by an uncommitted transaction.
      This prevents **cascading rollbacks**, where the rollback of one transaction forces the rollback of other dependent transactions.
    **Key Points:**
      - If **T2** reads data written by **T1**, then **T1** must commit before **T2** reads the data.
      - Stronger than recoverable schedules.
    **Example:**
      - **T1:** `w(X)`
      - **T2:** `r(X)`
      - **Schedule:** `w1(X), c1, r2(X), c2`
      - **Cascadeless:** T2 reads X only after T1 commits.
   - **3. Strict Schedule** A schedule is **strict** if no transaction reads or writes a data item that has been written by an uncommitted transaction.
     This ensures that no transaction is affected by the actions of an uncommitted transaction.
    **Key Points:**
      - If **T1** writes a data item, no other transaction can read or write that data item until **T1** commits or aborts.
      - Stronger than cascadeless schedules.
    **Example:**
      - **T1:** `w(X)`
      - **T2:** `r(X)`
      - **Schedule:** `w1(X), c1, r2(X), c2`
      - **Strict:** T2 reads X only after T1 commits.

### **Summary Table**

| Property          | Description                                                                 | Example                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Recoverable**   | No transaction commits until all transactions it depends on have committed.  | `w1(X), r2(X), c1, c2` (T2 commits after T1 commits).                   |
| **Cascadeless**   | No transaction reads data written by an uncommitted transaction.            | `w1(X), c1, r2(X), c2` (T2 reads X only after T1 commits).              |
| **Strict**        | No transaction reads or writes data written by an uncommitted transaction.  | `w1(X), c1, r2(X), c2` (T2 reads X only after T1 commits).              |


### **Hierarchy of Schedules**
- **Strict schedules** are a subset of **cascadeless schedules**.
- **Cascadeless schedules** are a subset of **recoverable schedules**.

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Recoverable:** Ensures no transaction commits before its dependencies.
- **Cascadeless:** Prevents cascading rollbacks by ensuring no transaction reads uncommitted data.
- **Strict:** Ensures no transaction reads or writes uncommitted data.

- **3 c)** When a **system failure** occurs before a transaction **T1** commits, the database may be left in an **inconsistent state** because some of **T1**'s changes may have
  been written to the database, while others may not have been. To recover the database to a **consistent state**, the system uses **recovery techniques**
  based on the **ACID properties** of transactions. Here's how the recovery process works:

### **1. Undo (Rollback) the Uncommitted Transaction**
Since **T1** did not commit, its changes must be **undone** to restore the database to a consistent state. This is done using the **undo log** (also called the **rollback log**).

#### **Steps:**
1. **Identify Uncommitted Transactions:**
   - The system checks the **transaction log** to identify all transactions that were active at the time of the failure (including **T1**).

2. **Undo Changes:**
   - For each uncommitted transaction, the system uses the **undo log** to reverse (roll back) all the changes made by the transaction.
   - For example, if **T1** wrote a value to data item **X**, the system restores the previous value of **X** from the undo log.

3. **Mark Transaction as Aborted:**
   - The transaction is marked as **aborted** in the transaction log.

### **2. Redo Committed Transactions**
If some transactions committed before the failure but their changes were not fully written to the database, the system uses the **redo log** to reapply those changes.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Identify Committed Transactions:**
   - The system checks the **transaction log** to identify all transactions that committed before the failure.

2. **Redo Changes:**
   - For each committed transaction, the system uses the **redo log** to reapply all the changes made by the transaction.
   - For example, if **T2** wrote a value to data item **Y**, the system reapplies that change to **Y**.

### **3. Transaction Log**
The **transaction log** is a critical component of the recovery process. It records all changes made by transactions, along with their status (started, committed, or aborted). The log contains:
- **Before-images (undo log):** The old values of data items before they were modified.
- **After-images (redo log):** The new values of data items after they were modified.
- **Transaction status:** Whether the transaction started, committed, or aborted.

### **4. Checkpointing**
To speed up the recovery process, the system periodically creates **checkpoints**. A checkpoint is a snapshot of the database state at a specific point in time. During recovery:
- The system only needs to process transactions that were active after the last checkpoint.
- This reduces the amount of log data that needs to be processed.

### **5. Recovery Algorithm**
The recovery process typically follows these steps:
1. **Analyze Phase:**
   - Identify the last checkpoint.
   - Determine which transactions were active at the time of the failure.

2. **Redo Phase:**
   - Redo all changes made by committed transactions (from the redo log).

3. **Undo Phase:**
   - Undo all changes made by uncommitted transactions (from the undo log).

### **Example Scenario**

#### **Transactions:**
- **T1:** `r(X); w(X);` (uncommitted at the time of failure)
- **T2:** `r(Y); w(Y); c` (committed before the failure)

#### **Database State Before Failure:**
- **X = 10**, **Y = 20**

#### **Changes Made:**
- **T1:** Writes `X = 15` (uncommitted).
- **T2:** Writes `Y = 25` (committed).

#### **Recovery Process:**
1. **Identify Transactions:**
   - **T1:** Uncommitted.
   - **T2:** Committed.

2. **Redo Phase:**
   - Reapply **T2**'s change: `Y = 25`.

3. **Undo Phase:**
   - Undo **T1**'s change: Restore `X = 10`.

4. **Final Database State:**
   - **X = 10**, **Y = 25** (consistent state).

### **Summary of Recovery Steps**

| Step               | Action                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Analyze**     | Identify the last checkpoint and active transactions.                  |
| **2. Redo**        | Reapply changes made by committed transactions.                        |
| **3. Undo**        | Reverse changes made by uncommitted transactions.                      |
| **4. Final State** | Database is restored to a consistent state.                            |

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Undo Log:** Used to roll back uncommitted transactions.
- **Redo Log:** Used to reapply committed transactions.
- **Transaction Log:** Records all changes and transaction statuses.
- **Checkpointing:** Speeds up recovery by reducing the amount of log data to process.
