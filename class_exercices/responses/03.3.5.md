# Reflection & Wrap-up

## (e) Why might a non-serial schedule still be considered correct, and how does this relate to the concept of equivalence in schedules?

---

A non-serial schedule can be considered correct because it can produce the same final database state and result set as a serial schedule, while offering better performance through concurrency. This notion of correctness is formalized through the concept of equivalence between schedules.

## Why Non-Serial Schedules Are Desirable

1. **Performance Benefits**: Serial schedules (where transactions run one after another with no overlap) significantly underutilize system resources and reduce throughput.

2. **Concurrency Advantages**: Non-serial schedules allow multiple transactions to execute concurrently, utilizing CPU, memory, and I/O resources more efficiently.

3. **Response Time**: Individual transactions can complete faster in a non-serial schedule since they don't have to wait for all previous transactions to finish.

## Correctness of Non-Serial Schedules

A non-serial schedule is considered correct if it maintains the ACID properties, particularly isolation - meaning that concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other in ways that produce incorrect results. This is formalized through the concept of equivalence.

## Schedule Equivalence Concepts

There are three main types of equivalence that define when a non-serial schedule can be considered correct:

### 1. Result Equivalence

Two schedules are result equivalent if:
- They produce the same final database state
- They return the same output to user queries

However, result equivalence is difficult to determine in practice, so database theory uses stronger notions of equivalence.

### 2. View Equivalence

Two schedules S₁ and S₂ are view equivalent if:

- For any read operation R in a transaction T, the same write operation W supplies the value in both schedules (i.e., reads see the same writes)
- The final write operations on each data item are performed by the same transaction in both schedules

View equivalence ensures that transactions "see" the same data values and produce the same final state.

### 3. Conflict Equivalence (Most Commonly Used)

Two schedules are conflict equivalent if:

- They involve the same transactions and operations
- All conflicting operations are ordered the same way in both schedules

Two operations conflict if:
- They belong to different transactions
- They operate on the same data item
- At least one of them is a write operation

### Key Relationship: Serializability

A non-serial schedule is considered correct if it is **serializable** - meaning it is equivalent to some serial schedule. There are corresponding types of serializability:

- **View Serializability**: A schedule is view serializable if it is view equivalent to some serial schedule
- **Conflict Serializability**: A schedule is conflict serializable if it is conflict equivalent to some serial schedule

Conflict serializability is more restrictive but easier to test for (using precedence graphs), which is why it's more commonly used in practice.

## Testing for Correct Non-Serial Schedules

### Conflict Serializability Test

1. **Construct a precedence graph**:
   - Nodes represent transactions
   - Directed edge from Tᵢ to Tⱼ if an operation in Tᵢ conflicts with and precedes an operation in Tⱼ

2. **Check for cycles**:
   - If the graph has no cycles, the schedule is conflict serializable
   - The topological ordering of the graph gives an equivalent serial schedule

### View Serializability

Testing for view serializability is NP-complete, making it impractical for runtime scheduling decisions.

## Practical Implications

Database systems don't usually try to determine serializability at runtime. Instead, they:

1. **Use concurrency control protocols** (like two-phase locking or timestamp ordering) that guarantee serializability

2. **Offer isolation levels** that may permit some non-serializable schedules for better performance, accepting certain types of anomalies

3. **Apply optimistic or multi-version concurrency control** that allow read operations to proceed without blocking

## Example of a Correct Non-Serial Schedule

Consider transactions T₁ and T₂:

```txt
T₁: R(A), W(A), R(B), W(B)  // Transfers money from A to B
T₂: R(C), W(C), R(D), W(D)  // Transfers money from C to D
```

A serial schedule might be: T₁, T₂

But this non-serial schedule is also correct (conflict serializable):

```txt
T₁: R(A), W(A)
T₂: R(C), W(C), R(D), W(D)
T₁: R(B), W(B)
```

This is correct because T₁ and T₂ operate on completely different data items, so their operations don't conflict. This schedule is equivalent to the serial schedule T₁,T₂, but offers better concurrency.

In summary, non-serial schedules are essential for performance in database systems, and the concept of equivalence gives us a formal framework to determine which concurrent executions are correct.
