# Reflection & Wrap-up

## (b) A non-repeatable read is a special case of a phantom, or is it the other way round?

---

Neither anomaly is strictly a special case of the other. They are related but distinct phenomena that affect different aspects of transaction consistency:

## Non-Repeatable Reads
A non-repeatable read occurs when a transaction reads the **same row** twice and gets different values because another transaction has modified and committed changes to that specific row between the reads.

**Example:**
- Transaction A reads row with ID=123, sees value X
- Transaction B updates row with ID=123 to value Y and commits
- Transaction A reads row with ID=123 again, now sees value Y
- Transaction A has now read inconsistent data within its own transaction

## Phantom Reads
A phantom read occurs when a transaction executes the **same query criteria** twice and gets a different set of rows because another transaction has inserted or deleted rows that match the query's condition.

**Example:**
- Transaction A queries `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE dept_id = 5` and gets 10 rows
- Transaction B inserts a new row with dept_id = 5 and commits
- Transaction A runs the same query again and gets 11 rows
- Transaction A has now seen a "phantom" row that wasn't there in its first read

## Key Distinctions

1. **Focus of change:**
   - Non-repeatable reads concern changes to **existing data** (updates)
   - Phantom reads concern changes to the **set of rows** that match a condition (inserts or deletes)

2. **Operation type:**
   - Non-repeatable reads involve UPDATE operations by other transactions
   - Phantom reads typically involve INSERT or DELETE operations by other transactions

3. **Isolation level prevention:**
   - Non-repeatable reads are prevented by REPEATABLE READ isolation level and higher
   - Phantom reads are only prevented by SERIALIZABLE isolation level in the SQL standard (though PostgreSQL prevents them at REPEATABLE READ level as well)

## Relationship

While they're different, there is a conceptual relationship:

- We could view a non-repeatable read as affecting the "value dimension" of data consistency
- We could view a phantom read as affecting the "set dimension" of data consistency

Some database theorists might argue that non-repeatable reads are a subset of the broader consistency issues that include phantoms, but in the SQL standard and practical database terminology, they are treated as distinct phenomena with different prevention mechanisms and implications.

The distinction matters in practice because some applications may be tolerant of phantoms but not of non-repeatable reads, or vice versa, allowing database designers to choose the appropriate isolation level.
